# TF Neural Networks on MNIST

Here are ipython notebooks of Tensorflow implementations of a regular Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, and a Long Short Term Memory Network on MNIST and an evaluation of their performance. This was done as a part of my Machine Learning Coursework (CSCI 5525)
